# Building and Contributing

If you want to know how to compile the source or even contribute to this project,
look at `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The document will tell you how you can get the project
files with git, compile them, and even how to contribute your code back into this
main repository.

Also take a look at the `CODESTYLE.md` file. It tells you how you should program
when you want your Pull Request mergerd into the project.

HAVE FUN CODING!
